# Self-Play_DQN_Project
IANNWTF Project WS22/23

The project was created using Python 3.10.8. The package requirements can be found in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). It is our final project for the course 'Implementing Artificial Neural Networks in Tensorflow' given in the winter semester 22/23 at Osnabr√ºck University. 

We trained DQN agents to play TikTakToe and ConnectFour using self-play.
